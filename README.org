** Introduction

For the past few years I've used Doom, but wanted to try a stripped down vanilla alternative built on a few core packages:

  - meow :: cool model editing package with a simple leader-key menu (rather than evil and which-key)
  - consult :: many of these commands populate the above leader-key menu

And of course, I also include:

  - vertico, marginalia, embark :: completion, annotation and contextual actions respectively
  - corfu :: at point completion
  - citar :: my citation package; this also helps me test configuration instructions
